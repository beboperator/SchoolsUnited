# Schools United
This repo contains styles, scripts, other code and assets used on the [SchoolsUnited.city](https://SchoolsUnited.city) website project.

## Things you can do here
1. Find code snippets in the `Content` folder to use in Blackbaud onMessage `Page Content` & `Master Layouts` if something breaks 😱.
2. Get the full CSS file to insert in the `Edit CSS` area of Blackbaud's `Styles` section 🎨.
3. Download fonts* or images from the `Assets` folder to use somewhere 🖼🔡.
4. Perhaps something else I left out 🤷‍♂️.

* The font included in this project is Grilli Type's *GT Walsheim Pro Trial* for testing so be cool & don't use it in production 🤙.
